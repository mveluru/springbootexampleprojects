/**
 * Logs every banking request - method, URI + query string, and the request body (the
 * "request object") - at INFO, tagged with the btid that {@link BusinessTransactionIdFilter}
 * already put in MDC. Sits after that filter and {@link BankingRateLimitFilter} (see
 * ordering in {@link BankingGatewayConfig}), so requests the rate limiter rejects never
 * reach it.
 * <p>
 * The body is only readable once a controller has consumed it, so the log line is written
 * <em>after</em> the chain runs ({@link #afterRequest}), from the cached copy that
 * {@link AbstractRequestLoggingFilter} makes when payload logging is on. As a result the
 * line is still emitted (with whatever body was read) when the controller rejects the
 * request. {@code beforeRequest} is deliberately a no-op: the body isn't cached yet, so a
 * "before" line would always log an empty payload.
 * <p>
 * Date of birth is masked before logging - it's the one field in these payloads that is
 * more sensitive than the names/addresses the app already logs elsewhere. Headers are not
 * logged at all.
