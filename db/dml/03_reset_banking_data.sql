-- =============================================================================
-- DML: DESTRUCTIVE - deletes ALL banking rows (withdrawal history, transactions, accounts,
-- customers, bank locations) but keeps the tables, and restarts their ids at 1. Leaves the events table alone.
-- Rows are deleted children-first so foreign keys don't block it.
--
-- To get demo data back afterwards, either restart the app (AccountDataSeeder re-seeds when
-- the accounts / bank_locations tables are empty) or run db/data/01_seed_customers_accounts.sql
-- and db/data/04_seed_bank_locations.sql.
-- If the app is running, its 10-minute account-search cache may still show the old accounts
-- until it expires or the app restarts.
--
-- Usage:   mysql -u <user> -p < db/dml/03_reset_banking_data.sql
