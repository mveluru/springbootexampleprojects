# SpringBootProjects (Brite Technology Notifications)

A Spring Boot 3 REST application demonstrating configuration properties binding (`@ConfigurationProperties`), custom REST controllers, async processing, JSON Schema-validated event ingestion, global exception handling, Spring Data JPA, and Spring Boot Actuator monitoring.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Configuration Management**: Strongly-typed properties bound via `@ConfigurationProperties` for notification options (App, Email, SMS, Retry).
- **Configs API**: Exposes endpoints under `/v1/configs` to query live application, email, and SMS configurations.
- **Product Catalog API**: Exposes endpoints under `/v1/product` to list, look up, and add products (in-memory catalog).
- **Banking APIs**: Client/account lookup, registration, withdrawal, and deposit (`/v1/client`, `/v1/api/accounts`) — accounts, customers, transactions, and withdrawal history are persisted via Spring Data JPA to the same MySQL database as the events module (see below), so data survives app restarts — plus async notification demos (`/notify`, `/report`) backed by `@Async`. Account numbers are always `CH-`/`SV-` (checking/savings) followed by a zero-padded 10-digit number (e.g. `CH-0000088291`), whether seeded or generated on registration. 52 demo accounts (26 checking, 26 savings) are seeded on first startup against an empty database (see [Data Model](#-banking-data-model-jpa) below).
- **Banking API Gateway & Rate Limiter**: Every banking endpoint (`/v1/api/accounts/**`, `/v1/api/locations/**`, `/v1/client/**`, `/v1/payment/**`, `/notify`, `/notify-sms`, `/report`) sits behind a `Filter`-based gateway ingress layer that requires an `X-Customer-Id` header and caps each customer to a configurable number of requests per day (`banking.rate-limit`, default 1000/day) — see [Banking API gateway](#-banking-api-gateway--rate-limiter) below. Retail/events/configs endpoints are unaffected.
- **Business Transaction ID (btid) Tracing**: The same gateway stamps every banking request with a unique `btid` (`X-BTID` response header) before it reaches any controller. The id is stored in SLF4J's MDC, so every log line from every layer of that request — controller, service, repository — carries it, letting you grep one request's full log trail with a single id.
- **Account Constraints**: Configurable business rules (`banking.constraints`) enforced on registration/withdrawal/deposit — minimum age to open an account, minimum balance retained after a withdrawal (checking/savings), and a maximum single cash-deposit amount.
- **Bank Statement**: `/v1/api/accounts/{accountNumber}/statement` returns an account's deposit/withdrawal history for a given date range, capped by a configurable maximum range in months.
- **Resilience Demo**: `/v1/payment/process` demonstrates a Resilience4j circuit breaker with jittered exponential-backoff retry around a simulated flaky downstream call.
- **Event Ingestion**: `/api/events` accepts versioned event payloads validated against a JSON Schema (`event-v1.json`) and persisted via Spring Data JPA.
- **API Versioning Demo**: `/apiversion` illustrates URI-, query-param-, header-, and content-negotiation-based API versioning strategies.
- **Actuator Monitoring**: Integrated Spring Boot Actuator exposing health status under `/actuator/health`.
- **Endpoint Execution-Time Logging**: A Spring AOP `@Aspect` (`ExecutionTimeLoggingAspect`, `org.bee.common.logging`) wraps every `@RestController` method app-wide and logs its execution time in milliseconds — no code changes needed per controller.
- **Account Search Caching**: `GET /v1/api/accounts` results are cached for 10 minutes via Spring's `@Cacheable` (Caffeine, `spring.cache.caffeine.spec: expireAfterWrite=10m`), evicted whenever an account is registered or closed.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Centralized exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`, with all exception and validation messages centralized in `BankingMessages`.
- **Structured Logging**: Slf4j logging across the banking module — info logs for successful operations, warn logs for validation/business rejections (insufficient funds, account not found, etc.) — with log message templates also centralized in `BankingMessages`.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL datasource integration with Hibernate / Spring Data JPA.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

All REST endpoints are prefixed with `http://localhost:8081/brite`:

### Configs — `/v1/configs`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/v1/configs/app-config/values` | Returns application connection pool size and timeout settings |
| `GET` | `/v1/configs/email-config/values` | Returns email notification configuration values |
| `GET` | `/v1/configs/sms-config/values` | Returns SMS notification configuration values |

### Product catalog — `/v1/product`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/v1/product/allproducts` | Returns all products in the catalog |
| `GET` | `/v1/product/productId/{productId}` | Returns a single product by ID, or `404` if not found |
| `POST` | `/v1/product/addproduct` | Adds a new product to the catalog and returns it |
| `GET` | `/v1/product/productmessage` | Triggers an internal product/user lookup and returns a confirmation message |

### Banking — clients, accounts & notifications

> Every endpoint below requires an `X-Customer-Id` header and is subject to the per-customer daily rate limit — see [Banking API gateway & rate limiter](#banking-api-gateway--rate-limiter).

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/v1/client/name` | Returns a sample customer record |
| `GET` | `/v1/api/accounts?accountNumber=&status=&createdFrom=&createdTo=&closedFrom=&closedTo=&months=&page=&size=&sort=` | Retrieves account ids/details within a createdDate/closedDate range, paginated (backed by a real JPA `Specification` query, cached for 10 minutes). All filters optional. **Default lookback**: if neither `createdFrom` nor `createdTo` is given, defaults to "as of today minus `months` months" (18 months if `months` is also omitted); supplying either explicit created-date bound disables this default and `months` is ignored (`400` if `months` isn't positive). **Conditional lookup**: if `accountNumber` is given, only that account is returned (still subject to the other filters — an out-of-range match yields an empty page, not a bypass); if omitted/null, every matching account is returned. Other filters: `status` (`ACTIVE`/`CLOSED`), `closedFrom`/`closedTo` (inclusive `yyyy-MM-dd` range), standard Spring Data `page`/`size`/`sort` (sortable by `createdDate`, `closedDate`, `accountStatus`, `accountNumber`; default `size=20`, sorted by `createdDate` ascending). Returns a Spring Data `Page<AccountStatusView>` envelope (`content`, `totalElements`, `totalPages`, etc) — each row is flattened to `accountNumber`, `accountType`, `accountStatus`, `createdDate`, `closedDate`, `firstName`, `lastName`, not the full nested `Account`/`Customer`. `400` if a `*From` date is after its `*To` date or an unsupported `sort` property is given |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/lookup` | Looks up an account by account number; `404` if not found |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/newaccount` | Registers a new customer + account |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/withdraw` | Withdraws funds from a checking/savings account; `400` on insufficient funds, mismatched account type, or a `CLOSED` account, `404` if the account doesn't exist |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/deposit` | Deposits funds into a checking/savings account; `400` on invalid amount/deposit type, mismatched account type, a cash amount over the configured maximum, or a `CLOSED` account, `404` if the account doesn't exist |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/{accountNumber}/close` | Closes a checking/savings account (status `ACTIVE` → `CLOSED`, stamps `closedDate`); `400` if already closed, `404` if the account doesn't exist |
| `POST` | `/v1/api/accounts/close` | Bulk-closes multiple accounts in one call (body: `{"accountNumbers": [...]}`). Best-effort — an invalid/already-closed account number doesn't block the others; the `200` response carries `closedAccounts` (the ones that succeeded) and `failures` (`accountNumber` + `reason` for the rest). `400` if `accountNumbers` is empty/missing |
| `GET` | `/v1/api/accounts/{accountNumber}/statement?beginDate=yyyy-MM-dd&endDate=yyyy-MM-dd` | Returns a bank statement (deposit/withdrawal history) for the account in the given range; each transaction includes `depositType` (`"cash"`/`"check"` for deposits, `null` for withdrawals); `400` if the range exceeds the configured maximum months, `404` if the account doesn't exist |
| `GET` | `/v1/api/locations?type=&city=&state=&zip=&service=&page=&size=&sort=` | Searches bank offices/ATMs, paginated (real JPA `Specification` query, not cached). All filters optional and AND'd; `city`/`state`/`zip` are case-insensitive exact matches. `type` matches by capability: `OFFICE` returns offices **and** office+ATM branches, `ATM` returns ATMs **and** office+ATM branches, `BOTH` only the branches with both. `service` is one of `BANKING`, `SAFE_DEPOSIT_LOCKER`, `LOANS_MORTGAGES`, `NOTARY`, `WIRE_TRANSFER`, `FOREIGN_EXCHANGE`, `ATM_CASH_WITHDRAWAL`, `ATM_DEPOSIT`. Sortable by `name` (default), `locationType`, `city`, `state`; default `size=20`. Each row has `name`, `bankAddress`, `locationType`, office `opensAt`/`closesAt` (`08:00:00`/`16:00:00`, wall clock in `timeZone` `America/Chicago`), office `phoneNumber` and `services` — hours and phone are `null` for ATM-only rows. `400` for an unsupported `sort` property or unknown `type`/`service` |
| `GET` | `/v1/api/locations/{id}` | Returns one bank office/ATM by id (same shape as a search row); `404` if no location has that id, `400` if `id` isn't numeric |
| `GET` | `/notify?name={name}` | Fire-and-forget async email notification demo |
| `GET` | `/report` | Async task that returns a completed report string |

### Banking API gateway & rate limiter

`BankingRateLimitFilter` (`org.bee.banking.gateway`) is a servlet `Filter` registered only for the banking module's URL patterns (`/v1/api/accounts/*`, `/v1/api/locations`, `/v1/api/locations/*`, `/v1/client/*`, `/v1/payment/*`, `/notify`, `/notify-sms`, `/report`) — it runs before `DispatcherServlet`, so rejected requests never reach a controller. It acts as a lightweight API-gateway ingress layer with two responsibilities:

1. **Customer identification** — every request must carry the header configured by `banking.rate-limit.customer-header-name` (default `X-Customer-Id`). Missing/blank header → `400` with a plain-text explanation.
2. **Per-customer daily rate limit** — each customer ID is capped at `banking.rate-limit.requests-per-day` (default **1000**) requests per calendar day, tracked in-memory and reset at midnight. Exceeding it → `429 Too Many Requests`.

Every response that reaches the filter (allowed or rejected) carries `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers. Set `banking.rate-limit.enabled: false` to bypass the whole gateway (e.g. for local scripting). The counters themselves are a single-instance, in-memory `ConcurrentHashMap` (unlike account/customer/transaction data, which is now persisted via JPA — see [Data Model](#-banking-data-model-jpa)) — not a distributed rate limiter — and the customer ID is a caller-supplied header rather than an authenticated principal, since the app has no auth layer.

A second filter, `BusinessTransactionIdFilter`, is registered on the same URL patterns but runs *first* (ahead of the rate limiter), so it stamps a unique business transaction id (`btid`, a UUID) onto every banking request before anything else touches it — including requests the rate limiter goes on to reject. The `btid` is put into SLF4J's MDC and echoed back as the `X-BTID` response header; every log line for that request, in every layer (controller, service, repository), automatically includes `[btid=...]` via the `logging.pattern.console` entry in `application.yml` — no parameter threading required. It's cleared from MDC in a `finally` block after each request so it never leaks onto Tomcat's reused worker threads. Logs outside any request (startup, scheduled tasks) show `[btid=-]`.

### Banking data model (JPA)

Banking used to be a `ConcurrentHashMap`-backed mock store; it's now backed by real JPA entities persisted to the same MySQL database (`db_example`) as the events module. The service/controller layers still use the same `Account`/`Customer`/`Address`/`AccountTransaction`/`WithdrawalForm` domain objects as before — the entity ↔ domain mapping is entirely internal to the repository classes, so no other code changed for this migration.

| Entity (`org.bee.banking.entity`) | Table | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `AccountEntity` | `accounts` | One row per real account (checking **or** savings) — not one row per customer pairing. `@Version` column for optimistic locking on concurrent withdraw/deposit. |
| `CustomerEntity` | `customers` | `@ManyToOne` from `AccountEntity`, cascades on save. |
| `AddressEmbeddable` | — | `@Embeddable`, inlined as columns on `CustomerEntity`/`WithdrawalHistoryEntity` — no separate table. |
| `AccountTransactionEntity` | `account_transactions` | One row per deposit/withdrawal, including `depositType`. |
| `WithdrawalHistoryEntity` | `withdrawal_history` | Separate withdrawal-specific history (write-only, nothing reads it back — same as before the migration). |
| `BankLocationEntity` | `bank_locations`, `bank_location_services` | A bank office and/or ATM: `locationType` (`OFFICE`/`ATM`/`BOTH`), address (`BankAddressEmbeddable`, inlined), office hours 08:00–16:00 in `America/Chicago` (Central time), office phone, and the set of `BankOperationServices` it serves (`BANKING`, `SAFE_DEPOSIT_LOCKER`, `LOANS_MORTGAGES`, `NOTARY`, `WIRE_TRANSFER`, `FOREIGN_EXCHANGE`, `ATM_CASH_WITHDRAWAL`, `ATM_DEPOSIT`) in the second table. ATM-only rows have no hours or phone. Domain shapes: `BankLocations`, `BankAddress`. |

Raw Spring Data repositories live in `org.bee.banking.repository.jpa` (`AccountJpaRepository` — extends `JpaSpecificationExecutor` for the dynamic account-search filtering — plus `CustomerJpaRepository`, `AccountTransactionJpaRepository`, `WithdrawalHistoryJpaRepository`); application code never touches them directly. `AccountRepository`/`TransactionRepository`/`WithdrawalRepository` (same names/packages as before) wrap them and keep their old public method signatures.

`BankLocationDataSeeder` likewise seeds 20 demo bank locations (8 office, 6 ATM, 6 office+ATM across Central-time cities) when `bank_locations` is empty. `AccountDataSeeder` seeds the 52 demo accounts on first startup, but only if the `accounts` table is empty — since data now persists across restarts, unconditional reseeding would create duplicates every time the app starts. Account numbers are still generated the same way as before (zero-padded 10-digit `CH-`/`SV-` numbers, starting from a `10001` counter), so previously-documented account numbers remain valid.

### Resilience demo — `/v1/payment`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/v1/payment/process` | Calls a simulated flaky bank service (40% failure rate) through a Resilience4j circuit breaker + jittered exponential-backoff retry; returns a fallback message once the breaker opens |

### Event ingestion — `/api/events`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/api/events` | Validates a `v1` event payload against JSON Schema, then persists it |

### Sample lookup — `/v1/sample`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/v1/sample/spl?item={item}` | Looks up a sample item count by name (e.g. `Mac`, `Dell`, `IBM`) |

### API versioning demo — `/apiversion`

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/v1/api` | Versioning via URI path (v1) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/v2/api` | Versioning via URI path (v2) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api?v1` | Versioning via request parameter (v1) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api?v2` | Versioning via request parameter (v2) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api` (header `X-API-VERSION: 1`) | Versioning via custom header (v1) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api` (header `X-API-VERSION: 2`) | Versioning via custom header (v2) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api` (`Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v1+json`) | Versioning via content negotiation (v1) |
| `GET` | `/apiversion/api` (`Accept: application/vnd.company.app-v2+json`) | Versioning via content negotiation (v2) |

### Monitoring

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/actuator/health` | Returns Spring Boot Actuator application health status (aggregates the `liveness`/`readiness` groups plus `db`, disk space, etc.) |
| `GET` | `/actuator/health/liveness` | Kubernetes liveness probe — `UP` as long as the process is running; never reflects the MySQL connection |
| `GET` | `/actuator/health/readiness` | Kubernetes readiness probe — `UP` only while the app's readiness state is `ACCEPTING_TRAFFIC` **and** the MySQL `db` health indicator is `UP` |

### API documentation (Swagger UI / OpenAPI)

| Method | Endpoint Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | `/swagger-ui/index.html` | Interactive Swagger UI for the banking module — full URL: `http://localhost:8081/brite/swagger-ui/index.html` |
| `GET` | `/openapi/banking-openapi.yaml` | The raw OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec that Swagger UI loads |

The spec is hand-written (not generated from the code), so update `src/main/resources/static/openapi/banking-openapi.yaml` whenever a banking controller, DTO, or error mapping changes. Loading the UI needs no `X-Customer-Id` header, but its "Try it out" calls do — click **Authorize** and enter a customer id first.

## ✅ Test Suite

Most tests use `@SpringBootTest` + `MockMvc` and require a running MySQL instance (same as the app itself); the banking module's service/gateway/aspect tests are plain unit tests needing neither Spring nor MySQL, and `AccountRepositoryTest` uses `@DataJpaTest` against embedded H2 instead of live MySQL. Run with:
```bash
mvn test
```

| Test Class | Covers |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ProductControllerTest` | `/v1/product` endpoints — list, get by ID (found + `404` not-found), add, product message |
| `BriteConfigValuesControllerTest` | `/v1/configs` config endpoints — app, email, SMS |
| `SpringBootProjectsApplicationTests` | Application context load + actuator health, liveness, and readiness probes |
| `AccountRepositoryTest` | `@DataJpaTest` against embedded H2 (no live MySQL needed — see [Data Model](#-banking-data-model-jpa)) — account creation defaults, ACTIVE/CLOSED status lifecycle, withdraw/deposit balance rules, account search/pagination/sorting/date-range filters, conditional accountNumber filter, all as real SQL |
| `ClientAccountServiceTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — registration age gating, withdraw/deposit input validation, deposit records a transaction with the correct `depositType`, bulk close (all succeed; partial failure doesn't block the rest) |
| `AccountStatusStatementServiceTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — account search date-range validation, Account → AccountStatusView mapping (checking vs savings account number, customer name), conditional accountNumber pass-through, default/overridden `months` lookback window |
| `CustomerRateLimiterTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — per-customer daily counter: decrements, blocks past the limit, independent per customer |
| `BankingRateLimitFilterTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — missing-header rejection, within-limit pass-through + headers, over-limit `429` |
| `BusinessTransactionIdFilterTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — btid is in MDC while the chain runs, echoed as `X-BTID`, cleared after (even on exception), and unique per request |
| `ExecutionTimeLoggingAspectTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — the `@Around` advice returns the join point's result and propagates exceptions unchanged |
| `AccountSearchCachingTest` | Plain unit test (no Spring context/MySQL) — reflection check that `listAccountStatuses` carries `@Cacheable` and `registerNewClientAccount`/`closeAccount` carry the matching `@CacheEvict` |
