-- =============================================================================
-- DML: the writes the banking module performs, as plain SQL. Each block is a self-contained
-- transaction driven by session variables (@acct, @amount, ...) - edit the SET lines and
-- run one block at a time in a MySQL client session (variables live only for the session).
--
-- The app enforces its business rules in Java (ClientAccountService/AccountRepository) and
-- protects concurrent updates with optimistic locking (accounts.version, bumped on every
-- change). These snippets reproduce the same rules with guarded UPDATEs so you can do the
-- same thing by hand; they are for admin/support use, not something the app runs.
-- ROW_COUNT() after each guarded UPDATE is 1 on success, 0 if a guard rejected it -
-- ROLLBACK instead of continuing when it is 0.
--
-- Rules mirrored (defaults from application.yml `banking.*`):
--   minimum age 18 | checking must keep >= 25.00 after a withdrawal | savings >= 100.00
--   cash deposit <= 5000.00 | CLOSED accounts reject withdraw/deposit | no reopen
